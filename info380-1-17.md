Types of Information Systems

PDF - Enterprise Systems
===
"Packaged Software" as one large system replacing and integrating hundreds of older legacy systems.

Benefits
---
- Increased efficiency by eliminating numerous redundant systems
- Integration of business processes across the enterprise
- Automating or eliminating manual data entry to reduce errors
- Tighter controls on inventory and other assets
- Providing businesses with the opportunity to integrate its systems with its cusomters and supplier
- Facilitating stronger customer relationships through better marketing and customer service

Challenges in Integration
---
- Excessive project costs
- Inability of businesses to adapt its business processes to the software
- Cultural resistance to change

Most fundamental types of IT are their core systems used:
- to execute business transactions internally with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems
- in customer-facing processes with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems
- and moving materials and information throughout the supply chain with Supply Chain Management (SCM) Systems

3 General Types of Information Systems
---
Computational Systems:
- Out-of-date systems that were used to automate certain repetitive activities e.g. calculating payroll
- Standalone systems were prevalent between 1950's and the 1980's
- Replaced humans => Reduced errors and gained more efficiency
- Mostly extinct in larger organizations

Functional Systems:
- Expanded to include the general functional areas around payroll, accounting and operational areas e.g. purchasing, production scheduling
- System encompassed all the related activites within a particular functional area
- More than automating activities; were about supporting a set of related activities
- More prevalent since the 1980's
- Benefits:
  - Integrate the various activities within a functional area of a business
- Limitation:
  - These systems work independently from other functional systems, not allowing the integration of activities within a business process across various functional areas or "silos"
  - Therefore, accounting systems are typically isolated from human resource and operations systems
  - Isolation translates into efficiency and effectiveness problems

Enterprise Systems:
- Designed mid-to-late 1990's
- Systems that integrate ALL key organizational functions across functional areas
- Consolidation of data from many standalone systems and functional systems into one centralized database
- Facilitate the activities within various functional areas in an integrated fashion across all steps of business processes
- a.k.a. process-based systems
- Challenges:
  - The integration of the needs and activities of various functional areas
  - Cultural issues such as competition among departments, conflicting needs, no clear line of authority in cross-functional and cross-business collaborations
- Sometimes mixture of enterprise and functional systems, but now moving to fully enterprise

Enterprise Systems - Internal Integration
---
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems integrate internal functional system:

- Integrates functional systems, such as HR systems, operations systems, accounting, etc.
- Into a central system served by a single database
- Functional systems cover primary and support activities
- ERP integrates all these systems for communication and coordination

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems integrate functional systems across the primary activities in business processes that interact with customers

- Not purely internal to the business, as it tracks all data relating to external customers

Enterprise Systems - External Integration
---
Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems
- Suppliers, distributers, and customers
- In-bound logistics: e.g. receive and store materials for manufacturing
- Out-bound logistics: e.g. product shipping

Summary
---
CRM:
- Primary Users
  - Sales, Marketing, Customer Service
- Primary Business Benefit
  - Sales forecasts, Sales strategies, Marketing campaigns

SCM:
- Primary Users
  - Customers, Resellers, Partners, Suppliers, Distributors
- Primary Business Benefit
  - Market demand, Resource and capacity constraints, Real-time scheduling

ERP:
- Primary Users
  - Accounting, Finance, Logistics, Production
- Primary Business Benefit
  - Forecasting, Planning, Purchasing, Material management, Warehousing, Inventory, Distribution

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems
---
- Integrates functional systems into a single system supported by one database to serve the needs of all functional areas in a business.
- Supports business processes across various functional areas in both primary and secondary support activities of the value chain
- Serves as backbone in providing fundamental decision-making support
- Enables/forces standardization of business processes

Main ERP Vendors:
- SAP
- Oracle Applications
- The Sage Group
- Microsoft Dynamics
- SSA Global Technologies

Benefits of ERP:
- Employees from various functional areas see same data
- Often ahve access to all data relevant to their function
- Eliminates data inconsistencies
- Provide reports with a complete business process view of the various activities across the enterprise and the status of the business
- Cost-effective customer service and inventory management
- Standardizes business processes across enterprise
- Reduces costs due to better inventory planning and labor need forecasting
- Promote better financial management
- Reduce overall production costs

Challenges of ERP:
- Costly and ineffective implementation
- Total implementation can exceed $100M
- Hardware, software, employee training, converting data, consulting fees, significant business process changes

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems
---
- Customer-centered strategy 
- Supports value chain activities involving customer interaction: marketing, selling, managing, delivering, and servicing the customer
- All customer related data are integrated into a single database
- Often offered as a module of an ERP system
- "Back office" analytical and reporting tools to better understand and profile customers

Customer Life Cycle:
- Marketing to target markets
  - Targeted email systems
  - Interactive web apps
- Presale (tracking lead customers)
  - Track sales forces' interactions
- Postsale (managing relationships and services)
  - Track data about customer purchases
  - Prioritize and allocate service

Benefits of CRM:
- Provide better customer service
- Make call centers more efficient
- Support sales force as they attract and secure new customers
- Retain existing customers
- Provide appropriate products and services to their customers
- Simplify marketing and sales processes
- Discover new customers

Challenges of CRM:
- The need to create a customer centric culture
- Software implementation is not sufficient to grow customer loyalty
- Training is needed to provide appropriate service to customers
- Primary activities need to be customer centric as well

Supply Chain Management (SCM) Systems
---
- Integrate inbound and outbound logistics activities across suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers
- Collects, analyzes, and distributes transactional information from all parts of value chain and makes them available to the business, suppliers, and customers
  - Modeling and simulation tools, algorithms, and applications that can build forecasts in advance

Study and track:
1. Material flow from suppliers at all levels
  - Which suppliers are available in the market
  - Which suppliers are most effective
  - Which suppliers are most reliable (quality and schedule)
  - Quotes and proposals from suppliers
  - Orders and payments to suppliers
2. Transformation of materials into products through production process
  - Arrival of raw materials
  - Production capacity
  - Production inefficiencies
  - Labor needs
3. Distribution of products to customers at all levels
  - Customer orders, purchasing behavior, demand

Benefits of SCM: 
- Supports decision making in business
- Forecast sales and adjust levels of inventory and labor needs
- Identify inefficiencies in processes
- Eliminate costly suppliers and customers
- Provide better service

Challenges of SCM:
- Must develop network of suppliers, distributors and customers that work well together
- Requires trust and coordination not easy to achieve due to possible competition
- Not easy to clearly know information system requirements of supply chain
