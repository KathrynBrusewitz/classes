Response to User Research
=========================
In order to identify patterns in user behavior, understand why they behave that way, and develop things to appeal to their real needs and wants, Hall advocates adopting "design ethnography", which is simply "the study of humans in their culture" (77). The methodology of design ethnography comprises of observing the users directly in their regular environment, which Hall broke down specifically into their physical environment (the setting the user will use the product), mental model (the users' pre-existing personal assumptions and biases), habits, and relationships (the users' social network) (77). A good example of this are questions an interviewer might ask prospective job candidates. Good questions that indicate suitability get the candidate to tell stories. This is very similar to how a designer will take into account users' behaviors and habits in a given situation and environment.

Another reason to utilize design ethnography is to eliminate wrong or generalized assumptions designers have about their users. Hall argues that our assumptions can potentially be annoying, insulting, and even discriminatory (79). Making well-informed, non-judgmental design decisions help build understanding and empathy for the user.

Hall puts forward four key points designers should keep in mind during user research. One, get well acquainted with just a sufficient number of users (83) as opposed to sending out a survey to thousands and treating the users as just another statistic. Two, don't design for ideal situations and environments but rather for the unpredictable and messy nature that is daily life. Three, utilize systematic analysis on observations. Lastly, design for personas.

For conducting effective and insightful interviews, Hall draws inspiration from the Ethnography Field Guide by the Helsinki Design Lab, which advises to listen more than talk, encourage the participant to share thoughts freely, avoid closed and leading questions, and note phrases and vocabulary they use. These tips help try to keep it as conversational as possible.

From user research and interviews, patterns behaviors and priorities are identified and a fictional user archetype - namely, a user persona - emerges. As Hall puts it, user personas "act as a reference point for decision-making" (119). Personas can be reused for different scenarios and even products. Of course, if the user research did not comprise of thoroughly observing and interviewing real people, the end result user persona would essentially be a made up character or a character that is too general to be effectively designed for. This danger can be prevented by following the design ethnography outlined here, as well as being familiar with and creating a diagram of the mental model of the user persona. The mental model can help frame the user persona's view of reality (127) and aid in design choices and features to include or scrap in the process.
