1/5 What is an Organization?
---
An Organization requires formal planning, division of labor, and leadership. 

Classical Organization
---
- Hierarchy of power and responsibility flow from top to bottom
- Each person in the organization should report to only one boss
- The responsibility and authority of every supervisor should be expressed clearly in writing
- Every person is responsible for the acts of her/his sub-ordinates
- Every person should be assigned a single function (or as less functions as possible) based on specialization and skills of the person
- Operation (line) functions and staff functions should be kept separate but line managers and staff managers should be encouraged to coordinate
- The span of control should be reasonable and feasible

Mechanistic Structure
---
- Rigid, efficient bureaucracy
- Reliable, stringent, logical
- Responsibility is well documented and authority is legitimate

Characteristics:

1. Division of labor strictly through functional specialization.
2. Rules that define the duties and rights of personnel should be clear and well-defined.
3. Procedures are predetermined to be used in different work situations.
4. Relationships and dealings should be impersonal among people.
5. Selection and promotion is based only on technical competence.

Some people argue that mechanistic forms treat people like workers and fail to recognize the importance of psychological needs of people. 

Organic Structure
---
- Based on humanistic models and needs of personnel
- Pays importance to emotional and social needs of people
- No rigid, stringent norms and authority isn't clear

Characteristics:

1. Tasks and roles are less rigidly defined and there is little emphasis on formal specializations.
2. Atmosphere is collegial and hence there is more information exchange and discussion (instead of orders and directions).
3. Decision making is decentralized and decisions are taken on demand by people who are currently involved in the operations at hand (which also assumes that people at the top need not be the best person to decide for the problem at hand).
4. Boundaries inside the organization are flexible and horizontal relationships are encouraged across teams or departments who are equally important and/or responsive to the problem. 

Centralization
---
Authority for most decisions is concentrated at the top apex. Impossible to have a purely centralized organization except in a very small company.

Decentralization
---
Authority is delegated through all levels of the organization. Also not possible to have complete decentralization.
