Analysis
- The second phase of the SDLC, in which system requirements are studied and structured

Application software
- Computer software designed to support organizational functions or processes. 
- Designed to support a specific organizational function or process like inventory management, payroll, or market analysis

Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools
- Software tools that provide automated support for some portion of the systems development process

Design
- The third phase of the SDLC, in which the description of the recommended solution is converted into logical and then physical system specifications

Implementation
- The fourth phase of the SDLC, in which the information system is coded, tested, installed, and supported in the organization

Information systems analysis and design
- The complex organizational process whereby computer-based information systems are developed and maintained

Inheritance
- The property that occurs when entity types or object classes are arranged in a hierarchy and each entity type or object class assumes the attributes and methods of its ancestors
- Allows new but related classes to be derived from existing classes

Logical design
- The part of the design phase of the SDLC in which all the functional features of the system chosen for development are described independently of any computer platform

Maintenance
- The final phase of the SDLC, in which an information system is systematically repaired and improved

Object
- A structure that encapsulates/packages attributes and methods that operate on those attributes
- An object is an abstraction of a real-world thing in which data and processes are placed together to model the structure and behavior of the real-world object

Object class
- A logical grouping of objects that have the same (or similar) attributes and behaviors (methods)

Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD)
- Systems development methodologies and techniques based on objects rather than data or processes

Physical design
- The part of the design phase of the SDLC in which the logical specifications of the system from logical design are transformed into technology-specific details from which all programming and system construction can be accomplished

Planning
- The first phase of the SDLC, in which an organization's total information system needs are identified, analyzed, prioritized, and arranged

Rational unified process (RUP)
- An iterative object-oriented systems development methodology
- RUP establishes four phases of development: inception, elaboration, construction, and transition

Systems analyst
- The organizational role most responsible for the analysis and design of information systems

Systems development life cycle (SDLC)
- The traditional methodology used to develop, maintain, and replace information systems

Systems development methodology
- A standard process followed in an organization to conduct all the steps necessary to analyze, design, implement, and maintain information systems

Questions
---
What is information systems analysis and design?
Organizational process used to develop and maintain computer-based information systems. An organizational improvement process.

How has systems analysis and design changed over the past four decades?
- In the early years, systems analysis and design was considered an art. Computers were large/expensive/unreliable, so emphasis was on automating existing processes. - All applications were built from scratch as there was no software industry.
- As systems development became more of a discipline, methodologies, techniques, and tools, have been developed to make analysis and design a disciplined process and more like engineering. Early database management systems (hierarchical and network models) helped bring discipline to the storage and retrieval of data. This shifted the focus of systems development from processes-first to data-first. 
- CASE tools were developed to make systems developers' work easier and more consistent. Organizations developed less software in-house and bought more from software vendors. The system developer transitioned from builder to integrator.

List and explain some of the problems with the traditional waterfall SDLC.
- Too tempting to ignore the need for feedback between phases and to treat each phase as complete unto itself, never to be revisited once finished
- Once a milestone was completed, it made it too expensive to go back and make changes once it was developed. it locked users into requirements that had been previously determined, even though those requirements might have changed
- Role of system users or customers was narrowly defined in advance. such assumptions coupled with limited user involvement, locked in requirements too early even after changes in the business conditions
- Analysis and design phases are given hard-and-fast dates for completion. success is measured by whether those dates are met. focusing on deadlines instead of obtaining and interpreting feedback, leads to lack of good analysis and design. this can increase development costs in extensive maintenance

What are CASE tools?
- Developed for internal use and for sale by several leading firms
- Used to support SDLC activities

Describe each major component of a comprehensive CASE system. Is any component more important than any other?
- Diagramming tools for system process, data, and control structures
- Computer display and report generators
- Analysis tools automatically checking for incomplete, inconsistent, or incorrect specifications in diagrams, forms, and reports
- A central repo storing specs, diagrams, reports
- Documentation generators produce technical and user documentation in standard formats
- Code generators directly from design documents, diagrams, forms and reports

Describe how CASE is used to support each phase of the SDLC.
- Planning - repo and documentation generators to develop project plans
- Analysis - diagramming to create process, logic, and data models
- Design - form and report generators to prototype designs; analysis and documentation generators to define specifications
- Implementation - code generators and analysis, form and report generators to develop system; documentation generators to develop system and user documentation
- Maintenance - all tools are used (repeat life cycle)

Explain what is meant by Agile Methodologies.
- Focus on adaptive rather than predictive methodologies
- Focus on people rather than roles
- Focus on self-adaptive processes
- Argues applying methods that work well for predictable, stable projects do not work well for fluid, design-heavy projects
- Iterative development => focuses on the frequent production of working versions
- Iterative development provides feedback to customers and developers

What is eXtreme Programming?
- Short cycles
- Incremental planning
- Focus on automated tests to monitor the development process
- Reliance on an evolutionary approach to development throughout lifetime of system
- Two-person programming teams (Pair Programming)
- Planning-Analysis-Design-Construction are one single phase of activity
- Coding and testing are intimately related parts of the same process
- The programmers also develop the tests
- Code is tested as soon as it is written

When would you use Agile Methodologies versus an engineering-based approach to development?
- If project involves...
  - Unpredictable or dynamic requirements
  - Responsible and motivated developers
  - Customer who understand the process and will get involved
  - Typically under 100 people

What is object-oriented analysis and design?
- Combines data and processes (called methods) into single entities called objects
- Objects correspond with real things: customers, suppliers, contracts
- OOAD makes sense even though typical systems development keeps data and processes independent of each other
- Goal is to make systems elements more reusable
- Object classes - Groups of objects sharing structure and behavior
- Shares iterative development approach of Agile

SDLC

Planning
- identify need for a new or enhanced system
- information needs of organization are examined
- projects to meet these needs are identified
- translate into a plan for the IS department
- schedule for development
- formal, preliminary investigation of system problem
- presentation of reasons why should/shouldn't be developed
- determine scope of proposed system

Analysis
- thorough analysis of current procedures and IS' used to perform tasks
- determine what users want from proposed system
- careful study of any current systems
- description of the recommended alternative solution

Design
- convert the description into logical and then physical system specifications

Logical Design
- independent of any specific hardware or software platform
- make sure the system functions as intended
- concentrates on the business aspects of the systems, overall high-level design

Physical Design
- design parts of the system to perform the physical operations necessary to facilitate data capture, processing, and information output
- create a working model of the system
- write detailed specifications and how they should be built
- identify programming language, the database system, hardware platform

Implementation
- turn system specifications into a working system that is tested and then put into use
- coding, testing, and installation
- users are introduced to the new system and trained
- initial user support, finalization of documentation, training programs, ongoing user assistance (documentation is produced throughout the life cycle)
- can continue for as long as the system exists (because of ongoing user support)

Maintenance
- programmers make the changes that users ask for and modify the system to reflect evolving business conditions
- a repetition of the other life cycle phases
- when maintenance becomes too costly, it is a sign to design the system's replacement and start the life cycle over again

PDF - What is MIS?
===
Business process
- Predefined way in which an organization performs its functions
- A set of organized activities, resources like people and materials, and information
- These interact to achieve business objectives
- Business processes produce information, that are then used by employees to perform other business processes and for future strategic decisions
- Business processes today are enabled by a variety of information systems (for example, ordering a latte from Starbucks, many business processes happen and IT systems used)

IS (Information System)
- A set interrelated business components that create, collect, process, store, distribute and produce information
- Support business transaction, learning, innovation and decision making

IS Triangle
- Illustrates the core components of all information systems such as people, process, and information technology
- Roles of the core IS components:
  - People - that use and manage these systems
  - Business processes - determine how we do business
  - IT - hardware and software that support and enable business processes
- All Information Systems have these three core elements

MIS Definition
- Strategically uses IT and people to solve business problems or capitalize on new opportunities
- Management of business processes and information
- Management information systems (MIS) is concerned with the effective integration of ALL components of IS

IS Architecture
- The MIS view of a business
- Three Major System Types:
  - ES - enterprise systems
  - BI - business intelligence systems
  - CS - collaboration systems

Enterprise Systems
- Transactions like orders, invoices, production plans, and inventories

Business Intelligence Systems
- Strategically use consolidated transaction and other business data to support decision making.
- E.g. uses data mining techniques to analyze sales to plan manufacturing production

Collaboration Systems
- Enable people to work together more effectively by facilitating sharing of information, ideas and knowledge

SDLC
- System Development Lifecycle
- A tool for solving business problems through analysis, design and implementation of information systems
- SDLC is a problem solving approach. Apply it to analyze the current state and requirements definition phrases
- Planning -> analysis -> design -> development -> implementation

Planning
- A.k.a. Requirements Definition
- Ensure the project approach aligns with key objectives
- Establish scope of project
- Refine objectives
- Prepares budget
- Prepares project schedule

Analysis
- A.k.a. Current State Analysis
- Know "As is" situation
- What is working well and what can be improved along lines of people, process and IT
- Figure out what the problems actually are

Design
- Focuses on the IT, the software supporting the overall system
- Designs for the development phase are drawn up
- Make a mockup of the solution

Development
- The IT is actually built or programmed

Implementation
- When the newly developed software gets to the end user and they are using it
