Response to _UX and Interaction Design_
=======================================
Norman defines affordances as "the relationship between a physical object and a person" (11). More specifically, how the object could be used is determined by the abilities of the user and the properties of the object. Norman goes further, saying perceived affordances "help people figure out what actions are possible" with the object. In the case of Disney's MagicBand, I would argue that due to it being a band, it can be easily perceived by the user that this band can be used for easy access to rides at the park, and this is exactly one of the uses of the band that Disney had engineered. No tickets are required at the park - just tapping the band at the gate and the rides is enough. Though to be a complete affordance, the device that the band taps onto will need to be obvious as well, or, in other words, it will be the signifier of this affordance. Signifiers, as Norman defines it, signal "where the action should take place" (14). 

In order to signal where to turn on the band, there is a circled Mickey icon that the user touches. If it is working, it flashes green and sounds a nice tone. If not, it glows blue. The design team purposely did not choose red, because, from the user's perspective, it means something bad happened. Bad feedback is not meant to ever be part of the user's experience at Disney World, only good feedback. This feedback is immediate and informative, two attributes, according to Norman, that are important for feedback (23). 

To deliver a frictionless experience for their users, sensors are built into the band. Their arrival to, say, the restaurant, alerts the host, greets them by their names, and tells them to sit anywhere they like and their food orders will deliver to their table without issue shortly. For the guests, this is like magic, a key element in the Disney experience. For other services, such as "Magical Express", the band alone allows users to board a shuttle, check into the hotel, not worry about their luggage, and replaces park tickets. The band streamlines the entire experience of traveling and enjoying Disney World.
