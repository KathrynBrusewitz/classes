Basics
===
```sql
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset
```

Number Operators
---
| Operator | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` | Standard numerical operators |
| `BETWEEN … AND …` | Number is within range of two values (inclusive) |
| `NOT BETWEEN … AND …` | Number is not within range of two values (inclusive) |
| `IN (…)` | Number exists in a list |
| `NOT IN (…)` | Number does not exist in a list |

String Operators
---
| Operator | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `=` | Case sensitive exact string comparison |
| `!=` or `<>` | Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison |
| `LIKE` | Case insensitive exact string comparison |
| `NOT LIKE` |  Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison |
| `%` | Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero or more characters (only with `LIKE` or `NOT LIKE`) |
| `_` | Used anywhere in a string to match a single character (only with `LIKE` or `NOT LIKE`) |
| `IN (...)` |  String exists in a list |
| `NOT IN (...)` |  String does not exist in a list |

Limiting results to a subset
---
`LIMIT`
:  Reduce the number of rows to return

`OFFSET`
:  Specify where to begin counting the number rows from

Removing Duplicates
---
`DISTINCT`
:  Discard rows that have a duplicate column value

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
```

Since the `DISTINCT` keyword will blindly remove duplicate rows, you can discard duplicates based on specific columns using grouping and the `GROUP BY` clause.

Multi-Table Queries
===
`INNER JOIN`
:  Match rows from the first table and the second table which have the same key (as defined by the ON constraint) to create a result row with the combined columns from both tables. Can be written simply as `JOIN`. These two are equivalent, but use `INNER JOIN` because they make the query easier to read once you start using other types of joins

```sql
SELECT column, another_table_column, …
FROM mytable
INNER JOIN another_table 
    ON mytable.id = another_table.id
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column, … ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```
