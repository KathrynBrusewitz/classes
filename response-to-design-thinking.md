Response to Design Thinking
===========================
Brown's designer is an all-encompassing designer who takes into account users' needs and desires and consider not only the aesthetics, but its functionality as well. The common perception of designers does not consider all the different skills one must hone in order to innovate and solve problems. As Brown puts forward in his article "Design Thinking", the common stereotype many people think the role a designer takes on "is tactical, and results in limited value creation", while the role of many designers today "is strategic, and leads to dramatic new forms of value" (86).

How? Designers employ what Brown calls "design thinking" - an approach for innovation which considers and requires understanding of people's needs and wants. Thomas Edison, who Brown gave as an excellent example of this methodology, blended "art, craft, science, business savvy, and an astute understanding of customers and markets" (86). This is in stark contrast to a typical description of a designer, such as someone with one narrow, specialized role to make products look more attractive. IDEO's shopping cart redesign showed how a team of designers with a variety of backgrounds go through a rigorous process of identifying problems with the modern-day shopping cart in both functionality and safety for the user and collaborate with shoppers in order to meet their needs and wants. This is in line with Brown's design thinking personality, which encompasses empathy (for the user, such as mothers with children and employees pushing carts back in place), integrative thinking (by thinking beyond existing alternatives for the shopping cart), experimentalism and collaboration (87).

Additionally, designers are not constricted to designing physical products, but are also needed to innovate "new sorts of processes, services, IT-powered interactions, entertainments, and ways of communicating and collaborating" (86). Brown writes how IDEO was employed by Kaiser Permanente to rethink the shift changes in the nursing-staff in order to improve the quality between patients and nurses. Through applying this human-centered design methodology and observation and prototyping, they significantly improved both their patients' experience and nurses' job satisfaction (88).
