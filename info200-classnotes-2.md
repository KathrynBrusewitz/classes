[Explanations on previous classnotes](info200-classnotes-1.md)

UX and Interaction Design
=========================
__UX__ is the practice of designing 
products,  
processes,  
services,  
events, and  
environments  
while focusing on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience

__Interaction Design__ aims to make things _intuitive_
It focuses on how people interact with objects, either directly (physical manipulation) or indirectly (software-based interfaces)

__Affordance__ is the relationship between a physical object and a person. Affordance is how the object could be used is determined by the _abilities of the user_ and the _properties of the object_.

__Signifiers__ signal where the action should take place.

__Feedback__ is immediate and informative.

__Constraints__ make it difficult or impossible to use the device incorrectly.

__Conventions__ are long established patterns that become learned signifiers or expected mappings.

Software User Interface Design
==============================
Help people scan by using a visual hierarchy:

- Font size
- Contrast
- White space
- Line lengths
- Pictures > Titles > Paragraphs
- Groups of 3 or 4
- Following the gaze of a face

Call-to-Action buttons have _higher contrast_ to stand out more.

Skeuomorphism
-------------
- Inefficient
- Cumbersome
- Easy to go overboard with

UI Design Steps
---------------
1. Determine the most common actions in addition to more advanced actions

2. Sketch rough screens that show how common actions are accomplished easily and intuitively; make more advanced actions possible through additional screens

3. Ruthlessly follow the design conventions for your target platform

4. Provide clear signifiers, mapping, and feedback

5. Enforce unavoidable constraints
	e.g. auto-saving content, rolling back versions

Designing Accessible Systems
============================
__Design for the extremes, which will in turn be innovative for everyone__

Models:

- __Medical Model__ - Need treatment and/or cure.
- __Education Model__ - Need special education.
- __Rehabilitation Model__ - Need assistive technology and training for employment and everyday life.
- __Legal Model__ - Citizens who have rights and responsibilities. Access to public buildings, voting, television, telephone, and education.
- __Social Model__ - Part of the diversity of life, not necessarily in need of treatment and cure. Society needs to make their world accessible.

__Accessibility concerns lead to major innovations__

- Phone - A.G. Bell trying to turn vibrations sound optically for teaching the deaf and dumb.”
- Acoustic Modem
- Speech Recognition and Synthesis (Siri)
- Picturephone -> Skype
- Captioning
- Tactile Graphics -> Braille Readers
- Notetaking Apps
- Visual Thinking/Analysis Tools
- iOS Text-to-Speech

VR/AR/MR Design
===============

- Virtual Reality - closed off from the real world
- Augmented Reality - not really interactive or even 3d; it is an overlay (HUD) on reality; gives information
- Mixed Reality - interactive, 3-dimensional holographic virtual objects in reality

Interpretive Flexibility concept
--------------------------------

What a new disruptive device is, and what it's good for, is often not immediately obvious, even to the inventor
Eventual social meaning and use of these devices are worked out over time through a _dialog_ between early adopters and manufacturers

Edison : phonograph, dictation  
Bell : telephone, replace telegraph  
Theremin -> Analog synthesizer

What is vr/ar/mr good for?
--------------------------
assistive tech e.g. medical/repair,  
learning/simulation/training,  
scientific/space exploration,  
conference meetings  
personal assistant/stats  
interior design, previewing decor  
exposure therapy  
reliving historical events

Agent vs Avatar
---------------
Agent - npc (computer controlled)  
Avatar - pc (user controlled)

Basic VR Guidelines
-------------------
- Always maintain head tracking
- keep the user grounded
- minimize acceleration and use constant velocity while moving
- overlay ui should be in 3d, 2-3 meters away from the viewer
- use a reticle to guide selection, rendered at the same depth as the object being targeted
- use spatial audio (3d sound effects)
- experiment with gaze cues (similar to hover effects)
