Response to _Data Science_
==========================
There is a mountain of biases in the HR hiring and promotion process. "Tall men get hired and promoted more frequently than short men, and make more money. Beautiful women get preferential treatment, too—unless their breasts are too large". A recent national survey by the Employment Law Alliance showed that attractive people are hired and promoted more frequently than unattractive people. Scholarly literature has shown older workers are able to learn and change and can be just as competent as younger workers, yet are constantly discriminated against in the hiring process. Millenials are often unjustifiably seen as "entitled and unable to think outside the box". Economists Sendhil Mullainathan and Marianne Bertrand demonstrated race still plays a factor today. All else equal, résumés with white-sounding names had more callbacks than those with black-sounding names. Hundreds of interviewers have admitted to recruiting those with a personality most similar to their own, or having interests most similar to theirs, and basically using their personal experiences as a model of merit.

The algorithmic assessment of workers’ potential can, however, introduce new biases. Evolv, a San Francisco-based company that creates tests and analyzes data about workers, has realized that factoring the distance an employee lives from work "could violate equal-employment-opportunity standards" in the U.S., because "different neighborhoods and towns can have different racial profiles". Stats on marital status, motherhood, church membership, can also have an impact on a worker's score.

After learning what Gild considers in their scores and ratings on coders and their proficiencies, I feel that I have something to work towards in order to have a better chance at scoring an interview and being hired for projects that I care about. I'm more aware now that I need to contribute more frequently to open-source code, refine my coding skills to be simplistic, elegant, and well-documented, participate in more programming-related online discussions, in addition to regularly ask questions and give quality answers on Stack Overflow to the best of my ability. Knowing that my online activity and active participation is being measured, analyzed and compared to hundreds of thousands of other developers overwhelms me but gives me a challenge and goal as well. Utilizing machine learning to more accurately identify trends in experience and skillsets and personalities is inevitable, so from my point of view, it's best to learn to live with it, not fight it, but at the same time, not lose sight that humans are changeable and are not just static data points. We can grow and develop and learn new skills, and our lives are built on an entire spectrum of emotions and experiences. Algorithms may not yet be sophisticated enough to account for the unpredictableness of life, as well as the potential unpredictableness of a single person's behavior.
