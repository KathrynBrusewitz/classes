Should the US adopt "right to be forgotten" as the EU has recently debated?
===
EU's "right to be forgotten ruling" states that "someone who wants information about them taken out of the index will have to apply to [the search engine]" - Google in particular, but any search engine that does business in the EU must abide. As explained in Charles Arthur's article in The Guardian, that information will then be decided if it must remain for the public interest. EU's view of privacy extends to information about people, and incorrect and outdated information should be removed from the index if someone requests it to be removed. However, that information would still exist - it is only the indexing that is removed. According to EU's "right to be forgotten" policy, key characteristics of the information in question that must be met for removal are that it must be: "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, [and] excessive in relation to the purposes of the processing". Additionally, the information is also tested in its relevancy and usefulness to the general public interest.

Problems that EU's "right to be forgotten" tries to solve can be addressed with existing laws in the United States. For example, defamation, legally known as libel, is one such problem that both US libel laws and EU's policy address. However, the EU policy does not appear to improve on existing US libel laws and can leave public interest at a disadvantage. One could argue that the court can rule that if a crime did not happen and was just libel, then, through a court order, it should be removed from searches under "right to be forgotten". But, this is, in a way, removing valuable history. This should be viewed as an individual not rewriting their history, but rather correcting a false article. Hence, the article itself should not be removed from searches; instead, the agency that first reported the false information should be forced to add an addendum to the article stating they were wrong and the article is false. 

This is beneficial and ideal. First of all, a track record is kept on reporters and news agencies. Frequently publishing and unpublishing false articles leaves little trace of proof that they did such things. On the other hand, if they are forced to announce publicly that an article is false, it brings attention to that fact in addition to giving readers the ability to make informed opinions about the agency. Second, there is the fact that publishing false material and unpublishing does not mean it is gone and "forgotten" forever. Once that article has been released, someone has already read it and someone has linked it. Search engines will have already indexed it. Other agencies will have written about it and have sourced the original article. When all things lead back to the original article stating it is false, then the person has a way to not just be forgotten, but also be freed from the lie.

Laws addressing revenge porn and libel are generally very narrow statutes that only apply when certain specific criteria are met, as opposed to the rather broad and vague criteria for information to be removed under "right to be forgotten", where information must be inadequate, irrelevant, and excessive. By these terms, it is possible to interpret it to mean that something that is completely not true would not be able to be removed by this policy. However, something that is completely true could possibly be removed because it can be determined to meet all three criteria based on someone's interpretation of events that have happened. As an example, a wife may accuse their husband as being abusive, however he may claim it was exaggerated and requests "right to be forgotten". Here, it is someones word against anothers. EU's criteria is not enough to determine whether it is libellous or not.

And then there is the fact that removing information from the internet, whether true or false, has potential to change the narrative of any story and can give rise to revisionist history. Once history is changed, the integrity of all information is compromised. The integrity of search engines are important because they make information accessible for people. The right to access this information can be argued to be a fundamental right. Article 5 in Germany's constitution states: "Anyone has the right to voice and distribute their opinion in speech, writing and picutres and to inform themselves from freely accessible sources without hindrance. Freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by broadcast and film are guaranteed. Censorship does not take place." When information is removed from the search index, the subject exercises their right to privacy, but the fundamental rights of everyone else are compromised: the right to access the information as well as the freedom of the press.

Igniyte, an "online reputation management" company (Burrell), advertises themselves to help individuals achieve "a positive presence online" by removing negative search results from Google. Igniyte asks, should people "who have cleaned their act up, should they be punished after 10 years?". What about a lawyer who wants to erase an embarrassing 10-year old trial loss from Google? Any future clients should have the right to be aware about that loss in order to make an informed decision, however, EU's policy is allowing for the ability to censor parts of history on a personal level. In the case of false information, it is worth reminding that removing all false information can be impossible. Though a website may be taken down or a link to a false article is removed from the front page of Google, another website may still have the false information or another link to a false article lives on the next page of a Google search.

It's often argued that we shouldn't be judged by past mistakes and embarrassing events that have been published on the internet from years ago. By request, as it isn't usually relevant anymore to our lives today, it can be removed and "forgotten" by EU's policy. But a better solution may just require a giant shift in our culture and thinking as a technological society. We should grow out of the idea of being ashamed of youthful indiscretions, so much as to erase all trace of them. In the future, perhaps if poor decisions and mistakes stayed on the internet and were available, people would learn to be more careful about what they do and say, and secondly, not worry so much about what someone has done or said (relative to the seriousness and damage caused by one's mistake) many years ago. History is best left remembered and learned from.
