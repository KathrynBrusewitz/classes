Response to _Information as Thing_
==================================
Buckland distinguishes three main uses of the term 'information' as follows: information-as-process, information-as-knowledge, and information-as-thing. 

Information-as-process denotes the action of being communicated of a fact or news. This process can be observed when someone is reading or watching the news - they are being informed of something, whether they have prior knowledge of it or not. 

Information-as-knowledge describes the intangible entity of facts or news that is perceived by the recipient. This kind of information is not an object, but rather the essence of information being communicated. For example, it can be a fact, such as being told “the capital of Canada is Ottawa”. This information obviously is not an object, or a document, or data, yet it is still knowledge, either true or false, that one gains once being told it. The perception of this information by the recipient will also affect or color this knowledge (351). One can choose to not believe this information, or even interpret it in a different way, yet this information is still knowledge they abstractly gain. 

Information-as-thing differs from the latter by representing tangible and informative objects, as opposed to abstract ideas and processes. Continuing the previous example, the informative object can be the document formalizing the city as the capital. It is instructive and is a physical representation of knowledge, a key concept of information-as-thing that Buckland identifies (352). Essentially, Buckland suggests that information-as-things are “objects [that] are collected, stored, retrieved, and examined as information, as a basis for becoming informed” (354). Evidence for these objects is the existence of systems of information that hold information. Archives, libraries and offices have systems that hold papers, letters, books, photos, all of which are essentially physical documentation of information. Computers are systems that hold data, which Buckland argues (354) is not so distinct from documents and text.
