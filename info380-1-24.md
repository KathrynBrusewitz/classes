Value chain analysis - Analyzing an organization's activities to determine where value is added to products and/or services and the costs incurred for doing so; usually also includes a comparison with the activities, added value, and costs of other organizations for the purpose of making improvements in the organization's operations and performance.

Incremental commitment - A strategy in systems analysis and design in which the project is reviewed after each phase and continuation of the project is rejustified.

Corporate strategic planning - An ongoing process that defines the mission, objectives, and strategies of an organization.  The process of developing and refining models of the current and future enterprise as well as a transition strategy. Executives typically develop a mission statement, statements of future corporate objectives, and strategies designed to help the organization reach its objectives.

Mission statement - A statement that makes it clear what business a company is in. 

Objective statements - A series of statements that express an organization's qualitative and quantitative goals for reaching a desired future position. "Broad and timeless" goals. These goals can be expressed as a series of statements that are either qualitative or quantitative but that typically do not contain details likely to change substantially over time. Objectives are often referred to as critical success factors.

Competitive strategy - The method by which an organization attempts to achieve its mission and objectives. In essence, the strategy is an organization’s game plan for playing in the competitive business world. Three generic strategies for reaching corporate objectives: low-cost producer, product differentiation, and product focus or niche.

Information systems planning (ISP) - An orderly means of assessing the information needs of an organization and defining the systems, databases, and technologies that will best satisfy those needs. The second planning process that can play a significant role in the quality of project identification and selection decisions.

Top-down planning - A generic ISP methodology that attempts to gain a broad understanding of the information systems needs of the entire organization.

Bottom-up planning - A generic information systems planning methodology that identifies and defines IS development projects based upon solving operational business problems or taking advantage of some business opportunities. 

Affinity clustering - The process of arranging planning matrix information so that clusters of information with a predetermined level or type of affinity are placed next to each other on a matrix report.

Electronic commerce (EC) - Internet-based communication to suppoert day-to-day business activities.

Business-to-consumer (B2C) - Electronic commerce between businesses and consumers.

Business-to-business (B2B) - Electronic commerce between business partners, such as suppliers and intermediaries.

Business-to-employee (B2E) - Electronic commerce between businesses and their employees.

Electronic data interchange (EDI) - The use of telecommunications technologies to directly transfer business documents between organizations.

I. Identifying and Selecting Systems Development Systems
---
__Project identification and selection:__

1. Identifying potential development projects
  - Selection Method 
    - characteristics
  - Top Management
    - Greater strategic focus
    - Largest project size
    - Longest project duration
    - Enterprise-wide consideration
    - "Top-down source"
  - Steering Committee
    - Cross-functional focus
    - Greater organizational change
    - Formal cost–benefit analysis
    - Larger and riskier projects
    - "Top-down source"
  - Functional Area
    - Narrow, nonstrategic focus
    - Faster development
    - Fewer users, management layers, and business functions involved
    - "Bottom-up source"
  - Development Group
     - Integration with existing systems focus
     - Fewer development delays
     - Less concern with cost–benefit analysis
    - "Bottom-up source"
2. Classifying and ranking IS development projects
  - Evaluation Criteria
    - Description
  - Value Chain Analysis
    - Extent to which activities add value and costs when developing products and/or services
  - Strategic Alignment
    - Extent to which the project is viewed as helping the organization achieve its strategic objectives and long-term goals
  - Potential Benefits
    - Extent to which the project is viewed as improving profits, customer service, and so forth, and the duration of these benefits
  - Resource Availability
    - Amount and type of resources 
    the project requires and their availability
  - Project Size/Duration
    - Number of individuals and the length of time needed to complete the project
  - Technical Difficulty/Risks
    - Level of technical difficulty to successfully complete the project within given time and resource constraints
3. Selecting IS development projects
  - Consider Factors...
    - Perceived and Real Needs
    - Existing and Available Resources
    - List of Potential and Ongoing Projects
    - Current Organizational Environment
    - Evaluation Criteria
  - Decision Outcome...
    - Accept Project
    - Reject Project
    - Delay Project
    - Refocus Project
    - End-User Development
    - Proof of Concept

__Deliverables and Outcomes:__

Primary deliverable is a schedule of specific IS development projects, coming from both top-down and bottom-up sources, to move into the next part of the planning phase — project initiation and planning.

Outcome is the assurance that careful consideration was given to project selection, with a clear understanding of how each project can help the organization reach its objectives. 

Due to the principle of incremental commitment, a selected project does not necessarily result in a working system.

Corporate and Information Systems Planning
---
The procedures used to access and process the data may change many times during that period. Thus, the challenge of most organizations is to design comprehensive information models containing data that are relatively independent from the languages and programs used to access, create, and update them.

The first step focuses on gaining an understanding of the current enterprise. Next, top management must determine where it wants the enterprise to be in the future. Finally, after gaining an understanding of the current and future enterprise, a strategic plan can be developed to guide this transition. The process of developing and refining models of the current and future enterprise as well as a transition strategy is often referred to as corporate strategic planning. During corporate strategic planning, executives typically develop a mission statement, statements of future corporate objectives, and strategies designed to help the organization reach its objectives. After defining its mission, an organization can then define its objectives. Once a company has defined its mission and objectives, a competitive strategy can be formulated.

__Generic Competitive Strategies:__

Low-Cost Producer: This strategy reflects competing in an industry on the basis of product or service cost to the consumer. For example, in the automobile industry, the South Korean–produced Hyundai is a product line that competes on the basis of low cost.

Product Differentiation: This competitive strategy reflects capitalizing on a key product criterion requested by the market (for example, high quality, style, performance, roominess). In the automobile industry, many manufacturers are trying to differentiate their products on the basis of quality (e.g., “At Ford, quality is job one.”).

Product Focus or Niche: This strategy is similar to both the low-cost and differentiation strategies but with a much narrower market focus. For example, a niche market in the automobile industry is the convertible sports car market. Within this market, some manufacturers may employ a low-cost strategy and others may employ a differentiation strategy based on performance or style.

__Information Systems Planning:__

Senior IS managers must model current and future organization informational needs and develop strategies and project plans to migrate the current information systems and technologies to their desired future state. 

_Step 1: Current Situation_

- listing of manual and automated processes
- listing of manual and automated data
- technology inventory
- human resources inventory
- Top-down planning:
  - conduct an extensive analysis of the organization’s mission, objectives, and strategy
  - determine the information requirements needed to meet each objective
- Bottom-up planning:
  - can be faster and less costly than using the top-down approach
  - has the advantage of identifying pressing organizational problems
  - often fails to view the informational needs of the entire organization
  - can result in the creation of disparate information systems and databases that are redundant or not easily integrated without substantial rework
  
Advantages to the Top-Down Planning Approach:

- Broader Perspective - If not viewed from the top, information systems may be implemented without first understanding the business from general management’s viewpoint.
- Improved Integration - If not viewed from the top, totally new management information systems may be implemented rather than planning how to evolve existing systems.
- Improved Management Support - If not viewed from the top, planners may lack sufficient management acceptance of the role of information systems in helping them achieve business objectives.
- Better Understanding - If not viewed from the top, planners may lack the understanding necessary to implement information systems across the entire business rather than simply to individual operating units.

_Step 2: Future Situation:_

- blueprints of manual and automated processes
- blueprints of manual and automated data
- technology blueprints
- human resources blueprints

The target situation must be developed in light of technology and business trends, in addition to organizational constraints. This means that lists of business trends and constraints should also be constructed in order to help ensure that the target situation reflects these issues.

_Step 3: Schedue of Projects_
- a detailed transition strategy and plan are developed by the IS planning team
- plan should be very comprehensive, reflecting broad, long-range issues in addition to providing sufficient detail to guide all levels of management concerning what needs to be done, how, when, and by whom in the organization
