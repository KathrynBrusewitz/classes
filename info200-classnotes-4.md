Nov 10 - Data Visualization
===
Typical Data Science Project  
1. Define a question you want to answer  
2. Design an empirical framework for answering it  
3. Gather data relevant to the question  
5. Clean the data  
5. Test hypotheses  
6. Communicate the results <- Data Visualization  

Two Forms of Data Visualization  
1. Visually encoding the results of a data analysis in order to _communicate_ insights and tell stories  
2. Visually encoding data to facilitate visual exploration that may _generate_ new insights

Visual Encoding
---
Which visual properties work best? Those that enable people to quickly and accurately 

Preattentive Perception
: Visual properties that humans distinguish immediately without even thinking about it.

Visual properties
: Orientation, length, width, size, shape, curvature, added marks, enclosure, shade, hue, 2d/3d position

Hue and shade might be hard to tell the difference if the difference in saturation is not enough. Animations add flicker, direction, and velocity

Designing a Data Visualization
---
1. What story do you want to tell about your data?  
2. Which data on which dimensions (x, y, z, time) and what kind of scale (linear, log, exponential)?  
3. Which data for each data point, and which visual encodings (shape, color, orientation, size, etc.)  
4. What labels, legends, annotations are needed?
