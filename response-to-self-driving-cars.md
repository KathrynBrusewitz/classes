Response to _Self-Driving Cars_
===
_According to Levy and Hwang, how have car manufacturers slowly lulled us into accepting the notion of self-driving cars? How can "design theater" help consumers make the transition from manual to full-autonomous systems?_

Small steps are being taken by most major car manufacturers to develop and implement advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), in order to gradually introduce autonomy to everyday commuting. Automatic braking systems, which determine whether a collision will happen and triggers the braking system if the driver does not react in time, will soon be a common feature. In March 2016, 20 automakers agreed to make automatic emergency braking systems a standard by 2022 (Moon). Autonomous cruise control (ACC), which automatically adjusts speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, can be found in most luxury vehicles and some mid-range cars. Parking assist systems have been implemented by major manufacturers, such as in the Mercedes C-Class, Volkswagen Passat, and Ford Focus. 

By integrating changes slowly, consumers feel less overwhelmed and nervous about radical changes while vetting the technology. Levy and Hwang explain that consumers tend to not adopt new technologies if it too obviously and uncomfortably departs from trusted patterns of use. To ease consumer concerns, car manufacturers are adopting design theaters - an object assuming the form of something familiar - in autonomy. One such design theater in the adoption of autonomy is the steering wheel. Nearly all of today's available self-driving vehicles still have steering wheels, even though it is not needed whatsoever. According to traditional manufacturers, such as Audi, GM, and Mercedes, the steering wheel is kept in case "the driver wants to drive" (Levy and Hwang). Levy and Hwang, however, explain that their true intention with keeping the steering wheel is to give the "new system temporal continuity". Another design theater making its way into cars is called "theater of volition". Placebo buttons are a common "theater of volition" - they lead the user to believe they have more control than they actually do. Some manufacturers of self-driving cars integrate synthetic engine noises in order to believe the car is actually working. To some consumers, a car with the classic, expected engine revving sound is more appealing.

_After watching Urmson's talk, would you ride in one of Uber's self-driving taxis, especially if there was no one in the front seat or if it had no driving controls at all? Why or why not? If you said no, what would it take for you to feel comfortable riding in one?_

I would absolutely choose to ride in one of Uber's self-driving taxis, or any self-driving car, whenever I have the chance. I don't currently live in the city, I live on the Eastside, so my commute can be up to 1.5 hours each way between home and UW, not to mention the time I spend driving for errands. Gaining 3 or more hours a day for doing anything else besides driving, such as working, studying or sleeping, would be a vast improvement to my life by reducing stress. Even if I lived in the city, which I would much prefer anyways to the rural countryside I currently live in, I would still choose to depend on Uber's self-driving cars. The fact that it is driverless does not bother me at all, but in fact, makes me feel safer than if it was driven by a human.
